HKU Fall 2014

###Learning Outcomes: 
This a lecture and studio class in computation design. The lectures, assignments and activities in this course center on physical interaction, playable spaces and interactivity. Beyond that, this class is about finding your voice as designers and storytelling. 

After this class, students will be able to program interactive experiences using the open frameworks platform while demonstrating an intellectual fluency in contextual relevance of their work. Students will understand how to present their work in a narrative context as a design presentation. 

#####Note:
There will be no class on October 2nd. 

###Projects and Deliverables:  
Weekly deliverables
Weekly there are small creative coding assignments to familiarize students with a specific programing concept or areas of Open Frameworks. These are announced in class and are requirements. Failing to complete these assignments leads to lower marks. Late assignments are not acceptable. These assignments are due at the start of every class and will be shown to all in a group critique. Participation in these critiques is also part of your grade. 

A common strategy for students having problems is to not show their work or skip class. Programming can be hard and sometimes it’s common to just get stuck even after hours of googling and research. That’s ok. Turn up anyway and submit your work. Not doing so is particularly self-destructive and will prevent growth. To quote Sister Corita Kent and John Cage, “Nothing is a mistake. There’s no win and no fail. There is only make.”  We can work together to improve and solve problems. Embrace the uncertainty. It’s just part of the process. 

Also, you might be asked to bring things into class the following week like a tee-shirt or a digital camera. Please always do this. It will help you learn and the class run smoothly. 

#####Github
You must maintain a github repository for this class and provide me with a link to this repo no later than class 2. 
<http://www.github.com>

This is not an optional step. Code must be uploaded here by class time. It is how you will be graded. All written presentations must be submitted in github flavor markdown, which is a kind of extremely simple html like language for displaying text and images, in your root repository folder folder. 

Good github editors include:
Mou <http://25.io/mou/> for mac 
Markdownpad <http://www.markdownpad.com>for windows. 

Documenting your process and using source control are huge parts of the life of a professional developer. 
`Comment your code. Uncommented code will go ungraded. These comments should allow fellow students to share and read your code to understand programing concepts.`

Part of your civic duty as a developer, particularly when using an open source tool such as open frameworks, is to share knowledge and be collaborative.   

####Final and Midterm:
You are also expected to do 2 larger projects. These projects should be internally motivated and explore idea prototypes for design ideas you are inspired to explore.

#####Due Dates:#####
Mini-project one is due Oct 30th (Midterm) 

Mini-project two is due Dec 4th (Final) 

The project must represent a concept or tell a story. You will be expected to present the project in an organized presentation. 

Prepare the following in github markdown format on your github repository in the project folder to share: 

	* Set up the project. 
	* Tell us the story of why you are doing what you are doing. What are you investigating? What inspired you? What is the social context your project operates within? 
	* At least one image of your project
	* A 200-300 word write up detailing your objectives 
	* If appropriate, a video of your project with narrative voice over
	* If your project includes hardware, a Fritzing or other circuit diagram 
<http://fritzing.org/home/>

At the end of this class, you should have two .md files in your repo. Midterm.md and final.md

####Evaluation####
I care about your competence, your passion, your bravery, your curiosity, your civic spirit, your generosity, your critical questioning and your moral compass.

I take for granted you will successfully fulfill the objectives above which are measurable such as attendance, participation, doing your homework and presenting your projects. Do not let yourself down in these ways. 

It is the other areas here that I am curious to watch you explore and begin to understand. Qualitative metrics are what will be the difference between a good grade and an exceptional mark. 

While these things are often unmeasurable, you will be given a numeric score on each assignment that reflects your competence in the concept at hand. 

`Your assignments must be uploaded by the start of every class to github.`

#####Attendance####
Be present. Unexcused abscesses are unacceptable as is late work. You will find I am understanding if you have real reasons for needing to miss class. However, these must be discussed with me and cannot become excessive. Just not turning up will negatively impact your grade. 

#####Class Policy#####
I require a respectful, safe and productive environment to be maintained in this classroom at all times. Beyond that, sustained disruption during presentations or lectures or general offensive behavior will not be tolerated.

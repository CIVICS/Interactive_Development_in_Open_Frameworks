#Week 2 

*****************************************************
***Homework:***

1. Create a game controller for the Makey Makey for a small little game you make up. Note that in this guide I show you how to use images and sound for added fun. As I mentioned in class, my Makey Makey is on the edge of my desk in the Games and Interaction lab if you want to test your interface. Also, there's a rumor you can check them out but I do not know if it's true. If your  laptop's arrows, mouse, space bar and click work in your game, they will work with the Makey Makey. We will try them out in class. Do not remove my hardware from the lab please and return it to my desk when you are done. It's my personal equipment, not HKU's. The code for this week is in the week 2 folder. The src folder is the one with the ofApp.h and ofApp.cpp files. 

2. Read chapter 1 of Playful Design by John Ferrara

3. Check out our designer of the week: Bora Yoon 
 <http://borayoon.com/> Bora uses everyday objects in her music. Pay careful attention to how she combines sound and visualization

#Installing all of the software you need for this class 

You will need 3 pieces of software:
Open Frameworks, an IDE for your computer (Visual Studio or XCode) and github.  


##1. Open Frameworks 
Open frameworks is an open source creative coding framework. It standardises many c++ libraries' syntax, such as quicktime and openCV, into a common format that's easy to read and understand.

What can you make in open frameworks and why would you want to learn it?

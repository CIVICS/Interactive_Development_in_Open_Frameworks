#Week 8
Topics: 
Vectors, Motion, Acceleration an Velocity 
This week's notes are simple. 

Go and read this chapter of this book and convert all of the exercises into c++.

<http://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-1-vectors/>

Do all of the examples for yourself **IN C++!!! **
 
Assignment: Start the Ecosystem Project at the bottom of the chapter. 

A few things to know if you missed class today 

* PVector is ofPoint() in oF 

* ofVect3 is a 3D point 

* all of the operators in oF are overloaded, which means you can just use the +, -, /, = and other math concepts without an additional function (See this week's code for exmaples.) 

For more on operator overloads look here:

All of today's lectures can be watched online here:

Watch videos 1.1 - 1.6

You will need to convert these ideas to open frameworks for yourself.  The code here for the week should really get you started.

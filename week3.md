* Setting up oF to work with Arudino 
* Sending serial communication to Open Frameworks 
* How to link a button to an onscreen graphics 


###Serial Communication with Arduino 
Arduino uses Serial data to communicate. Serial communication refers to communicating things one after another, in the most broad terms. This is what serial data is - communication between two entities being sent one bit at a time. You are sending either a 0 or a 1. In Arduino terms, 0 is LOW
